Welcome! I’m **Jia'nan Zhou (周佳楠)**, a grade 2 student majoring in Software Engineering at Sichuan University (SCU), China. I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, especially computer vision, machine learning, and algorithm design. I am actively exploring research opportunities and building projects that bridge theory and real-world applications.

Currently, I’m pursuing a dual-track academic plan, catching up on foundational courses while engaging in research training. My interests lie in:
- **Computer Vision**
- **Deep Learning and Pattern Recognition**
- **Software Engineering & Full-stack Development**
- **Data Structures and Algorithm Optimization**

I’ve worked on projects ranging from PyTorch-based image generation (CycleGAN variants), transactional scheduling systems with Wound-Wait protocols, to modern web development with Vue + Spring Boot. I'm also deeply interested in cross-disciplinary modeling (e.g., math modeling competitions) and plan to pursue further research or graduate study in Singapore or the U.S.
